This game I created is basically a Flappy Bird game, but I have added a point system where you can keep record of how far stay alive for.

The requirements needed for this project to be successful: - have either an AI/obstacle system or PVP characteristic.
- A design to show winner/loser.
- Display the game in the browser.
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY 
    (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world 
    can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best 
    practices)

How the game works:
1. Use spacebar to make your character jump as it fights against gravity and avoid touching the pipes and ground.
2. Get to highest score possible, and once a certain score is reached you will be announced a winner.
