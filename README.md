# Jumpy
This game I created is basically a Flappy Bird game, but I have added a point system where you can keep record of how far stay alive for. It's a game where you play as a bird and try to stay alive by avoiding touching pipes that move toward you, all while also not touching the ground. Otherwise, it will be game over.

## Requirements
The requirements needed for this project to be successful:
- A design to show winner/loser.
- Display the game in the browser.
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY 
    (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world 
    can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS

## How the game works:
1. Use spacebar to make your character jump as it fights against gravity and avoid touching the pipes and ground.
2. There will be top and bottom pipes/obstacles that move towards the bird horizontally-left. As the bird, you will have to try your best to stay in between the gap of the 2 pipes/obstacles AND avoid touching the ground to avoid making it game over.
3. Each time the bird jumps, the player will receive 10 points. Get to highest score possible and/or once a certain score is reached you will be announced a winner (for class demonstration purposes).

## Techniques used:
- For the game's framework, I stuck with utilized only JavaScript instead of Canvas. 
- Created different functions for obstacle movement, bird movements and collision detections.
